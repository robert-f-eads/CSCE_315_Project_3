Minutes from Previous Meeting
All members attended the previous meeting. Our agenda covered project setup and initial task assignments. We discussed status updates from the last meeting, namely things like project setup on laptops, web server functionality, and basic querying. We also went over completed tasks from the last meeting, like setting up GitHub, accessibility guidelines, panel views, etc., all of which were accomplished by various team members. We decided that for this meeting we would have a basic manager and server view, finish our object classes, and create a working search bar. We then assigned tasks to different team members.
