Minutes from Previous Meeting
We noted that all members were present from our previous meeting. In the meeting, we went over our updates from the previous meeting, namely things like style guide creation, the creation of some manager components, and how we want our customer view to display items. Furthermore, we discussed completed tasks, encompassing finishing object classes and database functions, adding order history viewing affordances on the manager view, and creating different tiles and inputs for the server view. We decided that for the next meeting we would like to convert some html components to React, perform some styling on our views, and connect our backend to our front end. These various tasks were assigned across our team.
