Minutes from Previous Meeting
We summarize the last meeting of our previous sprint. We noted that all members were present from our previous meeting. In the meeting, we went over our updates from the previous meeting, namely things like setting up public hosting, setting up a framework for traversal, and added data display functionality. Furthermore, we discussed completed tasks, encompassing creating order fields, creating product tiles, and having tables for some manager components. We decided that for the next meeting we would like to integrate all our views into a coherent page and complete our documentation. These various tasks were assigned across our team.
