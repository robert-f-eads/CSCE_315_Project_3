Minutes from Previous Meeting
We noted that all members were present from our previous meeting. In the meeting, we went over our updates from the previous meeting, namely things like layout frameworks for web server functionality, a new layout for the manager view, and added abilities for customers and servers. Furthermore, we discussed completed tasks, encompassing adding buttons for accessing different options, creating finish and pay functionality, and creating a display for product search results. We decided that for the next meeting we would like to finish expanding our web server endpoint, add more placeholders for the manager view, and create search results for additions in our server view. These various tasks were assigned across our team.
