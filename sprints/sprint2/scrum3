Minutes from Previous Meeting
We noted that all members were present from our previous meeting. In the meeting, we went over our updates from the previous meeting, namely things like completed visual aspects of our landing page, finished web server expansion, and text fields for needed product info. Furthermore, we discussed completed tasks, encompassing adding a navbar to our landing page, showing ingredient stocks, and creating a search button connected to our products. We decided that for the next meeting we would like to add easier modification abilities for the server view, complete the add product functionality in manager view, and finish our write order to database method. These various tasks were assigned across our team.
