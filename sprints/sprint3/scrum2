Minutes from Previous Meeting
All members were in attendance for the previous meeting. In the previous meeting, each member discussed their finished items, their in progress items, as well as any roadblocks or difficulties they were having. Some of these completed items included designing and implementing the employee login, as well as the customer and guest login, as well as providing color changes to indicate currently selected options for size, additions, and subtractions. Other finished items included the re-created server view layout, product search bar, and creating a functioning button that “re-orders” ingredients.  Members then discussed their roadblocks, including formatting issues, api limitations, and briefly helped each other brainstorm through these problems. Finally, members set into motion their plans for the next time and the meeting was closed.
