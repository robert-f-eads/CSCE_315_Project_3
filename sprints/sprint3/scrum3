Minutes from Previous Meeting
All group members attended the previous meeting. During the meeting, members discussed their completed items, then their in progress items, and finally any difficulties they were having throughout the time between meetings. There were several things to report as being finished, for example, installing the React router for page traversal, setting up API accounts as needed, and adding remove buttons to the cart functionality. Other completed tasks included creating a navbar and order panel for server view as well as adding & filling tables for the sales & excess reports.  Afterwards, team members discussed what needed to be done before the next meeting. These included implementing google maps API, as well as calculating the driving routes, and changing the side banner and top banner to be better formatted and easier to navigate. Other tasks to complete included enabling the Google Translate API, testing translation of dynamic and static elements, connecting the backend to the server view buttons, and creating product cards. At the end, the final assignments were divided up and the meeted ended.
